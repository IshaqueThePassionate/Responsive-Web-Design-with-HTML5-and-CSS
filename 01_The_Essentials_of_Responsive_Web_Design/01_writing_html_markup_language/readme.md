# **Writing HTML Markup  Language** 🚀

## Introduction 🌐

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is a fundamental language that structures web content, making it **understandable** for both technology and humans. While you can have content on the web **without CSS** or **JavaScript**, **you cannot have human-friendly content without HTML**. 🏗️📄

There is a misconception that writing **HTML is easy** and does not require much effort. However, creating **well-structured, accessible, and semantic HTML** requires knowledge and practice.

For users who depend on **assistive technologies**, poorly written HTML can make a website **confusing and unusable**. Therefore, writing **high-quality HTML** is not just about responsive design—it is **essential for accessibility** and a **good user experience**. 🎯

## HTML as a Living Standard 📜

HTML is a **living standard**, which means it is continuously evolving. A few years ago, **HTML5** was used to indicate modern web technologies, but now **HTML is simply HTML**. To stay updated with the latest HTML standards, visit:
